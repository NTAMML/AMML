        Title: Manifold Fitting Reveals Metabolomic Heterogeneity and Disease Associations in UK Biobank Populations <br>
        Abstract:  The community studying the connection between statistics and geometry is growing rapidly in both size and scope. The idea of manifold fitting dates back to H. Whitney's work in the early 1930s.  The Whitney extension problem has led to new approaches for data interpolation and inspired a set of questions now known as the Geometric Whitney Problems. One key question is: given a set of data, when can we find a smooth $d$-dimensional surface (or manifold) that approximates it well, and how accurately can we measure that fit in terms of distance and smoothness? In this talk, I will give an overview of the manifold fitting problem and discuss some recent insights and developments. I will focus on an application in NMR-based metabolomics, where we use manifold fitting to study metabolic variation in the UK Biobank population. Our method organizes 251 metabolic biomarkers into seven clusters, each representing a module of human metabolism. Within each cluster, we find low-dimensional structures that capture key patterns of metabolic variation linked to disease risk. In three of these clusters, the fitted manifolds clearly separate the population into two subgroups with distinct metabolic profiles. These subgroups are associated with a wide range of diseases, including metabolic, cardiovascular, and autoimmune disorders. This detailed stratification helps us better understand the links between metabolism and disease, and may inform personalized healthcare and preventive medicine. The discussion will draw on recent work by Yao, Yau, and collaborators, as well as ongoing research.

        Title:  Curvature-based sampling - From manifolds to networks <br>
        Abstract:  The problem of sampling and reconstruction of manifolds and, independently, of signals, has deep roots both in Differential Geometry as well as in Signal Processing. We overview the history of the subject and show that the two fields are not so widely divergent when sampling is concerned. Curvature, and more specifically Ricci curvature, represents the essential sampling tool. On the other hand, notions of discrete Ricci curvature have been proposed and applied with success in the study of Complex Networks. Thus, motivated by the methods and results of manifold sampling based on Ricci curvature, we are conduced to propose a similar sampling approach for networks. To this end we make appeal to three types of discrete curvature, namely the graph Forman-, full Forman- and Haantjes-Ricci curvatures for edge-based and node-based sampling. We present the results of experiments on real life networks, as well as for square grids arising in Image Processing. Moreover, we consider fitting Ricci flows, and we employ them for the detection of networks backbone. The relation between the Ricci curvature of the original manifold and that of a Ricci curvature driven discretization is also studied.

        Title: A spatial-correlated multitask linear mixed-effects model for imaging genetics <br>
        Abstract: Imaging genetics aims to uncover the hidden relationship between imaging quantitative traits (QTs) and genetic markers (e.g. single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)), and brings valuable insights into the pathogenesis of complex diseases, such as cancers and cognitive disorders. However, most linear models in imaging genetics didn't explicitly model the inner relationship among QTs, which might miss some potential efficiency gains from borrowing information across brain regions. In this work, we developed a novel Bayesian regression framework for identifying significant associations between QTs and genetic markers while explicitly modelling spatial dependency between QTs,  with the main contributions as follows. Firstly, we developed a spatial-correlated multitask linear mixed-effects model to model dependencies between QTs. We took full advantage of the dependent structure of brain imaging-derived QTs by introducing a population-level mixed effects term.  Secondly, we implemented the model in the Bayesian framework and derived a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to do model inference. Further, we incorporated the MCMC samples with the Cauchy combination test to examine the association between SNPs and QTs, which avoided computationally intractable multi-test issues. The simulation studies indicated improved power of our proposed model compared to classic models where inner dependencies of QTs were not modeled.

        Abstract: We address the challenge of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms within the approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) framework, which often get trapped in local optima due to their inherent local exploration mechanism. We propose a novel Global-Local ABC-MCMC algorithm that combines the ``exploration" capabilities of global proposals with the ``exploitation" finesse of local proposals. We integrate iterative importance resampling into the likelihood-free framework to establish an effective global proposal distribution, and select the optimum mixture of global and local moves based on a relative version of expected squared jumped distance via sequential optimization. Furthermore, we propose two adaptive schemes. The first adaptive scheme is a normalizing flow-based probabilistic distribution learning model to iteratively improve the proposal of importance sampling. The second adaptive scheme is optimizing the efficiency of the local sampler by utilizing Langevin dynamics and common random numbers. We numerically demonstrate that our method is able to improve sampling efficiency and achieve more reliable convergence for complex posteriors.

        Title: Commutative Algebra Learning <br>
        Abstract: Recently, we have introduced commutative algebra as an emerging paradigm for machine learning and data science. Specifically, we developed persistent Stanley-Reisner theory to bridge commutative algebra, algebraic topology, machine learning, and data science. We proposed persistent h-vectors, persistent f-vectors, persistent graded Betti numbers, persistent facet ideals, and facet persistence modules for data analysis. We show that commutative algebra predicts protein-ligand binding affinity, uncovers phylogenetic evolution, and reveals the genetic origins of diseases.

        Title: Local geometry determines global landscape in low-rank factorization for synchronization: theory and statistical bounds <br>
        Abstract: The orthogonal group synchronization problem, which focuses on recovering orthogonal group elements from their corrupted pairwise measurements, encompasses examples such as high-dimensional Kuramoto model on general signed networks, $\mathbb{Z}_2$-synchronization, community detection under stochastic block models, and orthogonal Procrustes problem. The semidefinite relaxation (SDR) has proven its power in solving this problem; however, its expensive computational costs impede its widespread practical applications. We consider the Burer-Monteiro factorization approach to the orthogonal group synchronization, an effective and scalable low-rank factorization to solve large scale SDPs. Despite the significant empirical successes of this factorization approach, it is still a challenging task to understand when the nonconvex optimization landscape is benign, i.e., the optimization landscape possesses only one local minimizer, which is also global. In this work, we demonstrate that if the degree of freedom within the factorization exceeds twice the condition number of the ``Laplacian" (certificate matrix) at the global minimizer, the optimization landscape is absent of spurious local minima. Our main theorem is purely algebraic and versatile, and it seamlessly applies to all the aforementioned examples: the nonconvex landscape remains benign under almost identical condition that enables the success of the SDR. Finally, we will discuss the statistical sides of group synchronization by quantifying the uncertainty of both MLE and spectral estimators, and introduce a few open problems in this area.

        Title: Pattern-type clustering of surveys: construals, bipolar items, and applications <br>
        Abstract: Empirical knowledge about construals—social affinity groups that share similar patterns of meaning to navigate social life—has grown significantly in recent years. This progress is largely due to the development of Construal Clustering Methods (CCMs), which analyze representative survey data to classify respondents into construal classes based on the similarity of their response patterns. In this talk, I will review existing CCMs and highlight their limitations, introducing a novel CCM called Bipolar Class Analysis (BCA), designed specifically for bipolar question data. Additionally, I will compare all CCMs through simulations, demonstrating the strengths of BCA as well as its limitations, which point to directions for future research. The talk will conclude with applications to real-world survey data, where BCA has provided novel or more robust insights into social construals.

        Title: Calculating higher digraph homotopy groups <br>
        Abstract: In 2014, Grigor'yan, Lin, Muranov and Yau introduced the homotopy theory of digraph and defined the digraph homotopy groups by taking the fundamental group of the (n-1)-fold iterated based loop digraph. Then inspired by the cubical approach to defining the higher homotopy groups of a based space, a more direct approach to defining higher digraph homotopy groups, which exhibits properties similar to those of the homotopy groups of based topological space, was given. At this point two questions naturally arise. Is there a digraph whose higher homotopy group is non-trivial? What other properties of higher homotopy groups for topological spaces have digraph analogues? The purpose of this paper is to address these questions. This is a joint work with Stephen Theriault, Jie Wu and Shing-Tung Yau.

        Title: Linear-quadratic extended mean field games with common noises <br>
        Abstract: In this paper, we consider a class of linear quadratic extended mean field games (MFGs) with common noises where the state coefficients and the cost functional vary with the mean field term in a nonlinear way. Based on stochastic maximum principle, solving the mean field game is transformed into solving a conditional mean field forward-backward stochastic differential equation (FBSDE). We first establish solvability for a type of (more general) conditional mean field FBSDEs under monotonicity conditions. We further provide some regularity results which lead to classical solutions for the associated master equations. In particular, the linear quadratic extended mean field game is solved and classical solution for (extended mean field game) master equation is obtained.

        Title: Mathematical AI for Molecular Sciences <br>
        Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) based Molecular Sciences have begun to gain momentum due to the great advancement in experimental data, computational power and learning models. However, a major issue that remains for all these AI-based learning models is the efficient molecular representations and featurization. Here we propose advanced mathematics-based molecular representations and featurization. Molecular structures and their interactions are represented by high-order topological and algebraic models (including Rips complex, Alpha complex, Neighborhood complex, Dowker complex, Hom-complex, Tor-algebra, Rhomboid tiling, etc). Mathematical invariants (from persistent homology, Ricci curvature, persistent spectral, Analytic torsion, algebraic variety, etc) are used as molecular descriptors for learning models. Further, we develop geometric and topological deep learning models to systematically incorporate molecular high-order, multiscale, and periodic information, and use them for analysing molecular data from chemistry, biology, and materials.

        Abstract: This talk investigates the mean-field dynamics of stochastic McKean (or Kuramoto-type) differential equations with particle interaction patterns described by large network/graph structures. These dynamics are fundamental in wide range of natural processes such as synchronization phenomena, opinion formation and biological mechanisms. We formulate the limiting McKean-Vlasov equation with a Vlasov interaction term that incorporates the recently developed graph limit theory of graph operators (or graphops). This allows us to cover a wide range of graph structures including dense, sparse and various intermediately dense cases. In this rather general setting, we prove global stability of the homogeneous steady state via entropy methods and provide explicit graph-structure dependent stability conditions and decay rates.

        Title: Generalized Moving Least-Squares Methods for Solving PDEs on Manifolds <br>
        Abstract: In this talk, we introduce the Generalized Moving Least-Squares (GMLS) method to solve the vector-valued PDEs on smooth 2D manifolds without boundaries embedded in R^3, identified with randomly sampled point cloud data. The approach formulates tangential derivatives on a submanifold as the projection of the directional derivative in the ambient Euclidean space onto the tangent space of the submanifold. One challenge of this method is that the discretization of vector Laplacians yields a matrix whose size relies on the ambient dimension. To overcome this issue, we reduce the dimension of vector Laplacian matrices by employing an appropriate projection so that the complexity of the method scales well with the dimension of manifolds rather than the ambient dimension. We also present supporting numerical examples, including eigenvalue problems, linear Poisson equations, and nonlinear Burgers' equations, to examine the numerical accuracy of the proposed method on various smooth manifolds.

        Title: Convergence Analysis of the Deep BSDE Method for McKean-Vlasov FBSDEs <br>
        Abstract: McKean-Vlasov equations model systems where dynamics depend on the distribution of the state, with applications in mean field games, systemic risk, and interacting particle systems. Their nonlocal and high-dimensional nature makes them challenging to solve numerically. The deep BSDE method offers a scalable approach to solving high-dimensional FBSDEs by combining time discretization, neural networks, and sampling. In this talk, I will present a convergence analysis of an adaptation of this method for McKean-Vlasov FBSDEs. The analysis covers time discretization, distribution approximation via particle method, and the convergence of the shooting method for the backward equation. This provides a first step toward rigorous guarantees for deep learning-based solvers in the McKean-Vlasov setting.

        Title: Continuous-time q-learning for mean-field control problems with common noise <br>
        Abstract: This paper investigates the continuous-time entropy-regularized reinforcement learning (RL) for mean-field control problems with common noise. We study the continuous-time counterpart of the Q-function in the mean-field model, coined as q-function in Jia and Zhou (2023) in the single agent's model. It is shown that the controlled common noise gives rise to a double integral term in the exploratory dynamic programming equation, rendering the policy improvement iteration intricate. The policy improvement at each iteration can be characterized by a first-order condition using the notion of partial linear derivative in policy. To devise some model-free RL algorithms, we introduce the integrated q-function (Iq-function) on distributions of both state and action, and an optimal policy can be identified as a two-layer fixed point to the soft argmax operator of the Iq-function. The martingale characterization of the value function and Iq-function is established by exhausting all test policies. This allows us to propose several algorithms including the Actor-Critic q-learning algorithm, in which the policy is updated in the Actor-step based on the policy improvement rule induced by the partial linear derivative of the Iq-function and the value function and Iq-function are updated simultaneously in the Critic-step based on the martingale orthogonality condition. In two examples, within and beyond LQ-control framework, we implement and compare our algorithms with satisfactory performance.

        Title: Universality of Condensation in Neural Networks Trained by Various Algorithms <br>
        Abstract: In this talk, we delve into three primary areas of research. First, we explore the dynamics of the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) for finite-width Deep Residual Networks (ResNet) using the neural tangent hierarchy (NTH) framework introduced by Huang and Yau, and we obtain that for ResNet with smooth and Lipschitz activation function, the requirement on the layer width $m$ with respect to the number of training samples $n$ can be reduced from quartic to cubic.  
        Secondly, we focus on the intriguing observation that neural networks exhibit distinct behaviors depending on the scales of initialization.  Drawing from previous research, notably the work by Luo et al., we present a phase diagram characterizing the phenomenon of initial condensation in two-layer neural networks and convolutional neural networks. Condensation refer to a situation where weight vectors in neural networks tend to concentrate on isolated orientations during the training process. This phenomenon is a key feature of nonlinear learning processes and contributes to enhancing the generalization capabilities of neural networks.
        Finally, we shift our focus to the Dropout algorithm, a widely adopted regularization technique in neural network training. We embark on a rigorous theoretical derivation of stochastic modified equations, with the primary objective of providing an effective approximation for the discrete iterative process of dropout.  Moreover, our empirical findings substantiate that  Dropout indeed facilitates the phenomenon of condensation at the end of training stage of neural networks.

        Title: Restricted Path Characteristic Function Determines the Law of Stochastic Processes <br>
        Abstract: A central question in rough path theory is characterising the law of stochastic processes. It is established in [I. Chevyrev & T. Lyons, Characteristic functions of measures on geometric rough paths, Ann. Probab.(2016), 4049--4082] that the path characteristic function (PCF), i.e., the expectation of the unitary development of the path, uniquely determines the law of the unparametrised path. We show that PCF restricted to certain subspaces of sparse matrices is sufficient to achieve this goal. The key to our arguments is an explicit algorithm -- as opposed to the nonconstructive approach in [I. Chevyrev & T. Lyons, op. cit.] -- for determining a generic element $X$ of the tensor algebra from its moment generating function. Our only assumption is that $X$ has a nonzero radius of convergence, which relaxes the condition of having an infinite radius of convergence in the literature. 
        As applications of the above theoretical findings, we propose the restricted path characteristic function distance (RPCFD), a novel distance function for probability measures on the path space that offers enormous advantages for dimension reduction. Its effectiveness is validated via hypothesis testing on fractional Brownian motions, thus demonstrating the potential of RPCFD in generative modeling for synthetic time series generation.
